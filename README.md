### Introduction
The project aims to extract as many faces as possible from the informed video/camera. The first module, [detector_module.py](https://github.com/RP11-AI/face-search-by-recognition/blob/main/py/detector_module.py) aims to perform a soft scan to extract as many face detections as possible. This module, in addition to generating a soft scan, gives the user freedom to record the video played, display the bounding boxes and manipulate other inputs for optimization or testing.

In the same module, a stack of images is also generated that will be saved in the automatically generated folder ***faces_bbox* **for future treatment with the other modules.

### Face Auth
In the second process, a more robust face detection process is performed. In [faceAuth.py](https://github.com/RP11-AI/face-search-by-recognition/blob/main/py/faceAuth.py) the detection will be performed by the png images. As the images are focused on possible faces, a more robust detection is more efficient. Images in which a face is not identified the system will delete.

### Face Recognition
In the module [faceRecognition.py](https://github.com/RP11-AI/face-search-by-recognition/blob/main/py/faceRecognition.py) the images that are still in the folder will be encoded. While the images are being encoded, they will be compared with themselves in a search engine to organize identical faces in the same specific directory.

After the process is finished, all the images will be organized in folders.

### Decoder
With the detections already organized, the module [decoder.py](https://github.com/RP11-AI/face-search-by-recognition/blob/main/py/decoder.py) will encode all the images in the folder and generate a master encoding of the identified person. Master encoding will be exported in csv.

In this module it will be possible to decode the csv file for future use by the identified people.
